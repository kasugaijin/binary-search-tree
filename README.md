# binary-search-tree
An exercise in creating and manipulating a balanced binary search tree. The program generates a random array, removes duplicates and sorts from low to high, then creates a balanced binary tree that can be visualised in the console. There are methods to add a node/value and find a value/node within the tree, and to traverse the tree using breadth-first and depth-first (pre, in and post order) methods. Most of these methods make use of recursion to traverse the tree.

This was a challenging exercise that really tested my understanding of recursion and the use of a queue and/or call stack for tree traversal. I will state that I did not create this code without support e.g., reviewing code for similar functions written in C or javascript. When doing it for the first time it is overwhelming, but seems so simple after reviewing other's code.

I was stumped by the methods to delete a node appropriately, and will return to this at a later date to complete once I have a better idea of what is required.
